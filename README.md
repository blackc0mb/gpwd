## 📌 Short description  
This project born as a personal need to make strong passwords quickly only for personal use and without the need (by now) to store in any database or something like that.<br/><br/><br/>



## How to use it ❓  
You just visit <a href="https://tmorales.dev/gpwd/" target="_blank">🔗 this link</a> then specify specify how many passwords as well as the length, after that you just have to click the **“clipboard” button** and that’s it.
